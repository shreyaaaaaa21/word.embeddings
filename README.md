<h1>Word Embeddings Project</h1>

<p>This project is focused on working with text data to explore and manipulate word embeddings, particularly around royal titles such as "king," "queen," "prince," and "princess." The project demonstrates basic text processing and data handling techniques using Python.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The core of the project involves reading a dataset of sentences, processing the text data, and performing basic transformations. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab and demonstrates the following key steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loading and reading text data from a file.</li>
    <li>Converting text to lowercase and cleaning unnecessary characters.</li>
    <li>Processing and displaying the modified text data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-embeddings-project.git</code></pre>
<p>Once cloned, upload the notebook to Google Colab and execute the cells step by step to see the output.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Ensure you have the following installed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>Google Colab account</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The notebook is structured to be easy to follow, with each cell containing comments that explain what the code does. Simply run each cell to see the transformations applied to the text data.</p>

<h2>Example Output</h2>
<p>The processed text data in the notebook includes sentences like:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>"the future king is the prince"</p>
    <p>"daughter is the princess"</p>
    <p>"son is the prince"</p>
</blockquote>
